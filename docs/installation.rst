Installation
============

Installing usualsuspects
------------------------

A stable version can be downloaded from PyPI

.. code-block:: none

	pip install usualsuspects

Installation from sources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most recent version can be cloned from the Github repository and then built from the project root folder

.. code-block:: none

	pip install .

If you wish to modify some of the source code for your own task, you can make a developer install. It is slightly slower, but immediately takes on any changes into the source code.

.. code-block:: none

	pip install -e .
