Welcome to usualsuspects's documentation!
=========================================

This is simply a personal collection of out-of-the box tools for making visualisations commonly found in ML papers.

.. note::
   This is primarily a personal project with the aim of practicing python packaging and good software engineering practices whilst developing something useful for me personally. If it helps you that's great! However, there are much more fleshed out visualisation aides out there done by large teams and dedicated individuals.

Feel free to explore how the tools are used in the examples found in the Github repo.
