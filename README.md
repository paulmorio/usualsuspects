The repo contains a small set of tools to create visualisations I constantly find inside of ML papers. It is also primarily a personal testbed for practicing software engineering practices and the whole PyPI/RTD/Github/CI ecosystem.

If you find any of the tools useful please consider leaving a star on the repo or contributing!

## Installation

The most stable version can be installed from PyPI via `pip` in the terminal.

```bash
pip install usualsuspects
```

Alternatively the *bleeding* edge version of this little library will be on the repo. Buiding from sources is as simple as cloning the repo and running a developer install in the root folder of the directory (where `setup.py` is) with:

```bash
pip install -e . 
```

This will allow you to adapt the source code to your liking and the changes will take effect immediately.

## Contributing
TODO. Will set this up after CI is set up.
